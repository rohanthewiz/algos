# Some Algorithm Solutions in Go
We want to keep a narrow focus on golang here, since it is the language of the cloud and many future things.

Run tests from the project root with `go test -v ./...`

For tests that do not run from project root, change to the particular package directory and run `go test`

### Contributing Guidelines
Contributions are welcome with just a few guidelines

- All code should be `go fmt`. Any kind of go fmt is fine.
- Provide unrelated algorithms in their own package. If unsure, make a new package.
- Since the intention here is to help myself and others learn, please, please provide meaningful comments in the code, if you really want to give a very verbose explanation that is welcome too, just create a README.md in that package folder.
- If something is unclear open an issue and we can have a discussion.
- Unit tests are highly recommended - not just for integrity, but as examples of usage.
- Please be kind and constructive, helping each other to become better developers. Thanks!
